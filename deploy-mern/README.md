# Deploy-mern
This repository is part of a tutorial to deploy a MERN application using Heroku. You can read more about it in the [blog post](https://dev.to/hawacodes/deploying-a-mern-app-with-heroku-3km7).
It contains a basic full-stack application which allows users to submit a quote with a form. All the quotes will be displayed in the web application.
